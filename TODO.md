# TODO

* implement pending nodes as a LIFO queue.
* remove old nodes more efficient
* check if we missed time (busy computing) when checking 
  min-wait-time / min-down-time.
* Should we send 'down' when putting node into wait state?
* subscribe to interfaces, keep interface numbers up-to-date
* cleanup nodes after a config change check all limits
